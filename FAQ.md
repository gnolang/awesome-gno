## FAQs

## Why did we choose go?

Go, apart from being a super simple and easy-to-learn language, it has some nice features that fit really well on the smart-contracts world:
    - All libraries, packages, and app code are intended to be public.
    - Because everything is public, importing a package is easy and straightforward.
    - Go tooling is really good.

### How are we going to manage the blockchain size?

This is something still in development, but one of the main ideas is to have several blockchains talking with each other through IBC protocol. Gno.land is intended to be a primary hub for the development of the ecosystem of the Gno programming language; similar to what GitHub is for the open source world. We expect many other chains to depend on the code developed on Gno.land, and as such tailoring Gno.land to fit every use-case is a non-goal.

### How is the company behind gno.land planning to make money?

25% of Genesis tokens will be owned by the company. That will encourage us to keep evolving and improving the ecosystem making it more valuable for the users. Also, we will create some packages and Realms that will be monetized thanks to Proof of Contribution.

### What is the difference between other smart contract solutions, like solidity?

- Gno code is interpreted directly from the source code. This is a deliberate decision, with the purpose to essentially enforce on the initial Gno.land chain and those that come after it to only be able to use the source code directly to execute the code. This is furthermore enforced by the license that will apply on our code, the [Gno Network Public License](link), a derivative of the GNU Afferro General Public License.
- Gno is almost identical to Go, so if you are a Go developer, you can have your first smart contract deployed in no time compared with other languages.
